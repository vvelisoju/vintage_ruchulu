Vintage Ruchulu — Static React Online Food Ordering App

1. Overview

Vintage Ruchulu is a food brand based in Warangal, offering authentic, homemade Non-Veg Pickles and (in future) other vintage food items.

This project is a fully static React web app that allows customers to browse products, add them to cart, and place an order via WhatsApp. No backend or database will be used; all data (products, images, prices, categories) is stored within the React codebase.
